# Tutorial - Write a Shell in C

## Basic lifetime of a shell

A shell does three main things in its lifetime.

- Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.
- Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
- Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.

In this shell, just call the looping function and then terrminate, not use any configuration files and not use any shutdown command. 

## Basic loop of a shell
a simple way to handle commands is with three steps:

- Read: Read the command from standard input.
- Parse: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.
- Execute: Run the parsed command.

```

void shell_loop(void)
{
  char *line;
  char **args;
  int status;

  do {
    printf("> ");
    line = shell_read_line();
    args = shell_split_line(line);
    status = shell_execute(args);

    free(line);
    free(args);
  } while (status);
}

```
Within the loop, we print a prompt, call a function to read a line, call a function to split the line into args, and execute the args. Finally, we free the line and arguments that we created earlier. Note that we’re using a status variable returned by shell_execute() to determine when to exit.

## Reading a line

```
char *lsh_read_line(void)
{
  char *line = NULL;
  ssize_t bufsize = 0; // have getline allocate a buffer for us
  getline(&line, &bufsize, stdin);
  return line;
}
```

## Parsing the line

we need to parse that line into a list of arguments. I’m going to make a glaring simplification here, and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line arguments. Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from each other. So the command echo "this message" would not call echo with a single argument this message, but rather it would call echo with two arguments: "this and message".

With those simplifications, all we need to do is “tokenize” the string using whitespace as delimiters. That means we can break out the classic library function strtok to do some of the dirty work for us.

```

#define LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE 64
#define LSH_TOK_DELIM " \t\r\n\a"
char **lsh_split_line(char *line)
{
  int bufsize = LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE, position = 0;
  char **tokens = malloc(bufsize * sizeof(char*));
  char *token;

  if (!tokens) {
    fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  token = strtok(line, LSH_TOK_DELIM);
  while (token != NULL) {
    tokens[position] = token;
    position++;

    if (position >= bufsize) {
      bufsize += LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE;
      tokens = realloc(tokens, bufsize * sizeof(char*));
      if (!tokens) {
        fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
    }

    token = strtok(NULL, LSH_TOK_DELIM);
  }
  tokens[position] = NULL;
  return tokens;
}
```

At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling strtok. It returns a pointer to the first token. What strtok() actually does is return pointers to within the string you give it, and place \0 bytes at the end of each token. We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character pointers.

Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary. The process repeats until no token is returned by strtok, at which point we null-terminate the list of tokens.
